 **Capstone project for Break Through Tech**
- This project focused on predicting Airbnb prices using machine learning. I started by cleaning the dataset, handling missing values, simplifying features like amenities_count, and encoding room_type into binary variables. I also filtered out outliers in the price column to reduce skew. For modeling, I began with a baseline Linear Regression, which performed poorly due to the likely non-linear nature of the data. I then moved on to a Random Forest Regressor and used GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters (n_estimators, max_depth, and min_samples_split). The final model achieved an RMSE of 70.72 and an RÂ² score of 0.38. While there was still some spread in predictions for high-priced listings, the Random Forest model captured the overall trend well and outperformed the baseline. Based on both metrics and visual inspection, it was selected as the best model for this dataset.
